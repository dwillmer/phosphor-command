/**
 * The basic details needed for a keyboard shortcut.
 *
 * Keyboard shortcuts are treated as permutations, not
 * combinations, because order is important. We may want to
 * support emacs/vi-style user commands, and therefore need
 * to differentiate between key orderings.
 *
 * In a number of common cases, instances conforming to IKeyPerm
 * will be created by the MenuManager, ie. when shortcuts are declared in
 * the menu items.
 *
 * However, we don't want to solely use the menu manager as the way of 
 * registering commands on keyboard input, because the menus may need to
 * be changed based on program execution (eg. context menus), and we may
 * still want other non-menu key combinations to work.
 *
 * In these cases, you canregister an IKeyPerm-conforming object with a keyboard
 * manager, and not through a menu manager.
