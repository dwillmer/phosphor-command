 * The basic details needed for a new command.

 * A 'command' in this context is an action to be performed
 * at a later point in time. We use the same terminology here
 * as WPF and Github's Atom editor. There are no UI items
 * specifically related to a 'command', a 'command' is simply a collection
 * of items which have sufficient knowledge to perform an action
 * at a later time.
 *
 * The UI items are created and used elsewhere in the application -
 * for example, one component may generate the menubar at the top
 * of the application from the registered commands which are (1)
 * in scope, and (2) have menu information present.
